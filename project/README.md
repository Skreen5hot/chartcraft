# Your Implementation

This directory is **your implementation space**. It is separate from the template's architecture documentation in `docs/`.

- `docs/` defines the **architecture contract** — how the template works and what rules it enforces.
- `project/` defines **what you are building** — your roadmap, technical spec, and decisions.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) | Phased plan with tasks, acceptance criteria, and scope boundaries |
| [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) | Technical specification for your domain-specific transform |
| [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md) | Architecture Decision Record — log decisions so they survive between sessions |

## Why This Exists

AI agents have no memory between sessions. These documents anchor every session to your project's current state. Before writing code, an agent should read `ROADMAP.md` to know what phase you're in and `SPEC.md` to understand the domain.

Keep these files updated. They are living documents, not artifacts.
