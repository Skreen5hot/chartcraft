## ADR-001: Use JSON-LD Deterministic Service Template

**Date:** [TODAY]

**Decision:** Adopt the JSON-LD Deterministic Service Template as the base architecture.

**Context:** We need a service that produces deterministic, reproducible transformations on structured data. The template provides a pure kernel with spec tests, layered boundaries (kernel/composition/adapters), and zero runtime dependencies.

**Consequences:**
- All transformation logic lives in `src/kernel/transform.ts` as pure functions
- Kernel MUST NOT perform I/O, reference time, randomness, or environment state
- Infrastructure (HTTP, persistence, scheduling) lives in `src/adapters/`
- Spec tests (determinism, no-network, snapshot, purity) MUST pass before any merge
